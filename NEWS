    * Fix crash in GTK+ greeter when a user is added
    * Move xsessions-directory and xgreeters-directory from [SeatDefaults] to

    * Drop most of the configure options, they aren't necessary
    * Config changes:
      - Major reorginisation of configuration to make it easier to configure and
        understand.  Users should set [SeatDefaults] section with settings for
        all seats, and can override each setting in a per seat configuration.
      - Default seats are now specified using a [Seat:<name>] section.  If no seats
        are specified then one is started.  This can be overridden by setting
        start-default-seat=false in [LightDM].
      - Support setting autologin user to guest account
      - Split the user accounts configuration into /etc/lightdm/users.conf so the
        main config can be private.
      - The default user session is now "default".  Distributions should put a
        symlink to their chosen default or set one in lightdm.conf.
      - XDMCP keys now stored in keys.conf
    * liblightdm API changes:
      - Both libraries are now version 1 and have API and ABI guarantees.
      - Face images are now local paths not URIs

      - Non-greeter functions are now moved out of the Greeter class
      - connect_to_server() is now called connect_sync and blocks until
        completion.
      - start_session() is now called start_session_sync and blocks until
        completion. The quit signal is removed, and the greeter should quit if
        this method returns TRUE.
      - login() is now called authenticate()
      - Greeters now have hints instead of configuration (greeters should load their
        own configuration from /etc/lightdm if they need it).
      - liblightdm-gobject uses AccountsService if it is available
      - Added regression tests for liblightdm-qt
    * D-Bus API changes:
      - Expose Seats and Sessions on org.freedesktop.DisplayManager
      - Add a CanSwitch property
      - Rename ShowGreeter() to SwitchToGreeter()
    * Greeter changes:
      - Drop "example" from the name of the GTK+ and Qt greeters and make them
        official default greeters.
      - Use GTK3 for GTK+ greeter.
      - Removed the Vala and Python GTK+ greeters, they weren't being well
        maintained.

    * Allow minimum-display-number to be set in lightdm.conf and on the command
      line.
    * Session X authority now written to ~/.Xauthority by default.  It can be
      configured to run from the system location by setting
      user-authority-in-system-dir=true in lightdm.conf.
    * When using system authority the authority can be updated by the user.
    * Written X authority files now checks hostname and display number.
    * Enironment is no longer passed through to X servers and sessions, this is
      no longer required now PAM works correctly.
    * liblightdm API changes:
      - Drop ldm_greeter_get_is_first() - it was added for testing and doesn't
        work well.

      be confused with new sessions.
    * Added XDMCP regression tests.

        may not be secrets.

      - show-message signal now has a MessageType field and takes over
        behaviour of show-error signal

      VT to be used for other displays.
    * On login switch to an existing session if already logged in with that
      username.
    * Correctly connect up D-Bus interface for user switching

    * Configuration changes:
      - Use /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf instead of /etc/lightdm.conf
      - The "displays" item is now called "seats".  LightDM will fallback to
